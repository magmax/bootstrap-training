# Bootstrap 4 training

You want to learn [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) and you don't know where
to start?

Well... This is my try.

The idea is very practical. Each lesson I will ask you to use a template in
order to get a result. I will give you some tips that will be revealed by
selecting them with the mouse. Example:


Tip: <span style="color: black; background-color: black">This is a tip</span>

So, download the source code and then follow the instructions to try to get the
result.

Good luck!
