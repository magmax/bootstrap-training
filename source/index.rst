Welcome to Bootstrap Training!
==============================

You want to learn Bootstrap_ and you don't know where to start?

Well... This is my try.

The idea is very practical. Each lesson I will ask you to use a template in order to get a result. I will give you some tips that will be revealed by selecting them with the mouse. Example:

.. raw:: html

   <p>Tip: <span style="color: black; background-color: black">This is a tip</span></p>

So, download the source code and then follow the instructions to try to get the result.

Good luck!
