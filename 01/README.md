# Lesson 1: The grid

Required time: 1-2 hours

Download the [source html code](source.html) and try to get [this
result](result.html). Avoid to see the result source code until you have it
done.

You can use the 
[layout documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/overview/) 
and [grid documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/)
when required. No other documentation pages should be required.

Try to avoid tips. If you require them, select them with the mouse.




Tip: <span style="color: black; background-color: black">Start with a
container-fluid class in the body or a new div object</span>

Tip: <span style="color: black; background-color: black">You can use the class
"col" to avoid to select the specific sizes.</span>
