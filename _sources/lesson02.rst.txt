Lesson 2: Tables
================

Required time: 1 hour

This is not a full Bootstrap_ course. I will center in just the main things in
order to get you using Bootstrap_ as quick as possible.

So, I will jump over all the styles and other shit like that to go directly to
more complicated stuff: tables.


Using this code:

.. literalinclude :: _static/02/source.html
   :language: html

Try to get this result:

.. raw:: html

    <iframe src="_static/02/result.html" height="345px" width="100%"></iframe>

You can use the `tables documentation`_ when required. No other documentation pages should be required.

**IMPORTANT**: You must use just the ``class`` attribute. Neither javascript nor
``style`` attribute or tag are required.

Try to avoid tips. If you require them, select them with the mouse.


.. raw:: html

    <p>Tip: <span style="color: black; background-color: black">Start with a container-fluid class in the body or a new div object</span></p>


.. raw:: html

    <p>Tip: <span style="color: black; background-color: black">You can use the class "col" to avoid to select the specific sizes.</span></p>
